# Signed Commits

This project requires signed commits for security and authenticity. We use SSH-based signing (Git 2.34+).

## Setup SSH Signing

Configure Git to sign commits with your SSH key:

```bash
# Set SSH as the signing format
git config --global gpg.format ssh

# Set your SSH public key as the signing key
git config --global user.signingkey ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Enable automatic commit signing
git config --global commit.gpgsign true

# Enable automatic tag signing
git config --global tag.gpgsign true
```

## Verify Signed Commits

To verify a commit is signed:

```bash
git log --show-signature
```

## Why Signed Commits?

- **Authenticity**: Proves commits are from verified contributors
- **Integrity**: Ensures commits haven't been tampered with
- **Security**: Protects against impersonation attacks
- **Trust**: Builds confidence in the codebase history

All commits in this repository are signed with SSH keys for maximum security.
